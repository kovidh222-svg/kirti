# 8 Idiots

A small website made to preserve moments, friendships, and memories.

This project isn’t about perfection, performance, or production standards.
It’s simply a space to keep what mattered — the people, the time, and the moments we didn’t know would mean this much later.

## About the Project

We became close without ever planning it.
Somewhere between conversations, games, random plans, and everyday moments, we found each other.

This website exists to:

* hold shared memories
* showcase moments through visuals and motion
* slow things down and let us remember

Nothing more. Nothing less.

## What This Site Is

* A memory space
* A visual story
* A personal archive
* A reminder of a time that shaped us

## What This Site Is Not

* A commercial product
* A polished portfolio
* A brand
* A serious web app

---

## Tech Stack

* Next.js / React
* Three.js + React Three Fiber
* Framer Motion
* Tailwind CSS

Used only to support the feeling — not to show off.

## Why This Exists

Some things don’t need explanations.
They just need a place to stay.

---

## Final Note

These are just moments.
But they meant more than we knew then.
